# Emotion Engine Py

## Overview
Emotion Engine is a small "toy engine" and framework built around Pygame, designed to facilitate rapid game development. This engine is specifically tailored for creating very simple games, visualizations, and quick testing of ideas. It provides essential tools and utilities that simplify the game development process, allowing developers to focus on creativity and experimentation rather than low-level details.

## Getting Started - try the Pong game built with Emotion
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kstzl/EmotionEnginePy.git

```
